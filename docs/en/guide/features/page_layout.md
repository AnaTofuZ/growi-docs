# GROWI page layout

![](./images/page_layout.png)

In order to operate GROWI comfortably, let's first understand the basic layout.

## Page Title (ページタイトル)

The title of the page is displayed here.
Here you can [Copy titles and URLs to clipboard](./ copy_to_clipboard.md) and tag pages.

## Page Toolbar (ページツールバー)

A toolbar that performs operations related to pages.

In addition to editing the page, [Check Update History](./history.md) and [Move / Duplicate / Delete Page](./page_operation.md) are also performed from this page toolbar.

## Page Sidebar (ページサイドバー)

If you write a headline in the page, the heading list will be displayed here as a sidebar.

Use the sidebar to jump to the desired location immediately when the content of the page becomes long.

## Page creation button (ページ作成ボタン)

The buttons for creating pages are in the upper right corner of the screen.

You can create a regular page, or create a new page using the template function.
