# Check page update history

![](./images/history.png)

GROWI allows you to check the page update history.

It can be confirmed by clicking the “Update History” tab in the same row as View and Edit tab.

By clicking the “View this version” link, you can display the page edited at that time.

This is useful when you want to rewind content to a past page.
